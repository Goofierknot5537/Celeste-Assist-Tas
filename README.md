# Celeste-Assist-Tas
This is where I put my Celeste Assist Tas Inputs.

I reference many, many inputs from the CelesteTAS Input files, which you can find [here](https://github.com/VampireFlower/CelesteTAS).

Tbh I don't really know how to use github but at least here somebody can make suggestions and get the raw files.
